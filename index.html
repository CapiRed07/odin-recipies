        <h1>Medieval Recipes</h1>
                <p>Medieval age comprehends a lapse of more than 1000 years. This time alone is enough to get lost in the depths of knowledge and information about different cultures and it's traditions.</p>
        <p>Often, when thinking about Medieval times, an occurrent question is <em>What did people eat back then?</em>.</p>
        <p>The sole combination of the words <em>medieval</em> and <em>food</em> floods people with questions, from <i>"they didn't have spices back then"</i> to <i>"they used to eat raw/spoiled meat disguised with spices"</i></p>
