        <h1>Flaune of Almayne</h1>
        <img src="../images/flaune.jpg" alt="Flaune of Almayne photo">
        <p>This recipe is a bit of an oddity. A sort of cross between a fruit tart and a custard. The result is a sort of fine, apple-flavored, bread pudding in a pie crust. The apple flavor seems to be stronger when it is served cold, and is really brought out by adding the cinnamon-sugar at the end.</p>
        <ul><strong><i>Ingredients</i></strong>
            <li>1/4 cup currants</li>
            <li>4 apples</li>
            <li>1/2 cup cream</li>
            <li>6 eggs</li>
            <li>1/4 cup sugar</li>
            <li>2 slices bread, ground</li>
            <li>2 Tbsp. butter, melted</li>
        </ul>
        <ol><strong><i>Preparation</i></strong>
            <li>Start by melting the butter</li>
            <li>Peel, core, and quarter apples</li>
            <li>Grind with currants in a mortar (or food processor)</li>
            <li>Beat eggs well and add remaining ingredients</li>
            <li>Pour into pie shell and bake at 350Â°F until it rises at the center (it should be done in about an hour)</li>
            <li>Allow to cool</li>
            <li>Sprinkle with cinnamon-sugar and serve</li>
        </ol>
