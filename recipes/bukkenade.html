        <p>Numerous versions of this recipe can be found throughout history. This version is one of the more commons, using beef instead of veal. The result is a pleasantly different and spicy stew, perfect for dunking slices of bread.</p>
        <ul><strong><i>Ingredients</i></strong>
            <li>2-3 lbs. beef, cut into cubes</li>
            <li>1 Tbsp. parsley</li>
            <li>1 tsp. sage</li>
            <li>1 tsp. hyssop</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp. cloves</li>
            <li>1/4 tsp. mace</li>
            <li>4 egg yolks</li>
            <li>3/8 cups verjuice</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp. ginger</li>
            <li>1 tsp. salt</li>
            <li>Pinch saffron</li>
        </ul>
        <p><em>Given the case hyssop is unavailable, leave it out. If verjuice is unavailable, use 1/4 cup wine and 1/8 cup lemon juice.</em></p>
        <ol><strong><i>Preparation</i></strong>
            <li>Put the beef into a large pot along with water to cover (about 8 cups)</li>
            <li>Bring to a boil, reduce heat, and simmer for 30 minutes</li>
            <li>Skim off and discard any scum that forms on the surface</li>
            <li>Add parsley, sage, hyssop, cloves, and mace</li>
            <li>Stir well and simmer for another 30 minutes <i>(or until the beef is tender)</i></li>
            <li>Temper the egg yolks in a separate bowl by slowly whisking in a cup or two of the broth from the pot</li>
            <li>Add the remaining ingredients to the pot along with the egg mixture and stir</li>
            <li>Remove from heat when as soon as it comes back to a boil</li>
        </ol>
