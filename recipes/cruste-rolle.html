        <p><i>Lorey pastries. To make little Lorey pastries, make pastries the size of a blank or smaller, and fry them. The pastry should not be too high [thick?]. If you wish to make some lettuces and small ears, make pastry lids, some larger than others, and fry them in lard until they are as hard as if cooked in an oven. If you wish, gild them with gold or silver leaf, or with saffron.</i></p>
