        <img src="../images/hypocras.jpg" alt="Hypocras photo">
        <p>Spiced wines have been popular for centuries, and the spices used haven't changed much since 14th century. Instructions for making hypocras can be found in medieval cookbooks from several countries, making it one of the most common recipes across the period.</p>
        <p><em>A non-alcoholic version of hypocras can be made, main difference would be to use grape juice instead of wine. Recipe can be found in this same web page, right after the preparation of alcoholic version.</em></p>
        <ul><strong><i>Ingredients</i></strong>
            <li>2 cups red wine (white wine can be used too)</li>
            <li>1 tsp. <i>powder douce</i></li>
            <li>2 - 3 Tbsp. sugar, according to taste</li>
        </ul>
        <p><i><strong>Remember</strong> powder douce recipe can be found on home page if you don't have it.</i></p>
        <ol><strong><i>Preparation</i></strong>
            <li>Put ingredients together into a pitcher or other vessel with a pour spout</li>
            <li>Stir until sugar dissolves</li>
            <li>Serve warm and or cold</li>
        </ol>

        <ul><strong><i>Ingredients</i></strong>
            <li>2 cups grape juice</li>
            <li>1 tsp. <i>powder douce</i></li>
            <li>2 - 3 Tbsp. sugar, according to taste(depends on the sweetness of the juice, discard if too sweet)</li>
            <li>Wine vinegar (if you want tartness)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The preparation for the non-alcoholic hypocras is similar, with just a few adjustments, a non-alcoholic hypocras can be achieved.</p>
        <ol><strong><i>Preparation</i></strong>
            <li>Put ingredients together into a pitcher or other vessel with a pour spout</li>
            <li>Add one or two teaspoons of red wine vinegar for a bit of tartness</li>
            <li>Stir until sugar (if added) dissolves</li>
            <li>Serve warm or cold</li>
            <em>Depending on the sweetness of the grape juice, the amount of sugar may be reduced or eliminated entirely</em>
