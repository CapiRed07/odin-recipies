        <p>This recipe is suspected to evolved from the medieval drink <i>"caudel"</i>. It's flavor is something of a cross between beer and pumpkin pie. A very interesting one.</p>
        <p><em>Note that this recipe doesn't get cooked long enough for the alcohol to boil off, so if a non-alcoholic beverage is desired, it is recommended to use a non-alcoholic beer from the start.</em></p>
        <ul><strong><i>Ingredients</i></strong>
            <li>12 oz. beer</li>
            <li>1 egg yolk</li>
            <li>1/4 cup sugar</li>
            <li>1/16 tsp. nutmeg</li>
            <li>1/16 tsp. cloves</li>
            <li>1/16 tsp. ginger</li>
            <li>2 Tbsp. butter</li>
        </ul>
        <ol><strong><i></i></strong>
            <li>Put the egg yolk into a saucepan and slowly whisk in beer</li>
            <li>Add sugar and spices</li>
            <li>Heat over medium-high heat until mixture starts to come to a boil</li>
            <li>Remove from heat</li>
            <li>Add butter and whisk until mixed</li>
            <li>Serve hot</li>
        </ol>
