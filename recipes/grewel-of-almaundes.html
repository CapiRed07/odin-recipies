        <h1>Grewel of Almaundes</h1>
        <p>A strange recipe to modern Western tastes, falls directly into the uncanny valley between sweet and savory. The almonds give it a sweetness that makes it unlikely as a side-dish for dinner, but it's nowhere sweet and thick enough to make a good dessert. It might make a good breakfast food, if not accustomed to really sweet breakfast.</p>
        <p>From a medieval viewpoint however, the dish was likely considered to be ideal. Something ever so slightly sweet doesn't disturb the balance of the dinner's humors. This is why simple gruels were considered an excellent food for the elderly and infirm.</p>
        <p>While most gruel recipes call for broth and often contained meat, this one is unusual in its use of almonds. While it is not explicitly stated in any of the source recipes, it's most probable was intended as a soup for meatless days or during lent.</p>
        <ul><strong><i>Ingredients</i></strong>
            <li>1/4 cup blanched almonds</li>
            <li>1/4 cup steel-cut oats</li>
            <li>2 cups water</li>
            <li>Pinch saffron</li>
            <li>1/4 tsp. salt</li>
        </ul>
        <ol><strong><i>Preparation</i></strong>
            <li>Start by blanching the almonds</li>
            <li>Right after, grind them until they are like coarse breadcrumbs</li>
            <li>Place them in a saucepan with the remaining ingredients</li>
            <li>Bring to a boil and then reduce heat</li>
            <li>Simmer until the mixture thickens and the oatmeal is tender (about 10 minutes)</li>
            <em>Note that the cooking time can vary significantly depending on the type of oats used.</em>
