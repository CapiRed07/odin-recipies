        <p>Many medieval recipes call for spice mixtures without detailing the exact spices. While it is tempting to assume that each particular spice mixture had a consistent recipe, there is evidence of substantial variation for different times, regions, budgets, and of course, cooks. The recipe below (also called <i>Poudre douce</i>) is for one of the more commonly called for spice mixtures. Altering it to suite each ones tastes is highly recommended.</p>
        <ul><strong><i>Ingredients</i></strong>
            <li>3 Tbsp. ginger</li>
            <li>2 Tbsp. sugar</li>
            <li>1 1/2 Tbsp. cinnamon</li>
            <li>1 tsp. cloves</li>
            <li>1 tsp. nutmeg</li>
        </ul>
        <ol><strong><i>Preparation</i></strong>
            <li>Grind whole spices in a mortar (or food processor)</li>
            <li>Mix well after and store them in a jar-bowl</li>
            <em>If using spices like ginger, you can also hand-grate them (or could make them fine powder with a processor or some sort as well)</em>
        </ol>
        <p><i>HIPPOCRAS. To make powdered hippocras, take a quarter-ounce of very fine cinnamon, hand-picked by tasting it, an ounce of very fine meche ginger and an ounce of grains of paradise, a sixth of an ounce of nutmeg and galingale together, and pound it all together. And when you want to make hippocras, take a good half-ounce or more of this powder and two quarter-ounces of sugar, and mix them together, and a quart of wine as measured in Paris. And note that the powder and the sugar mixed together make "duke's powder".</i></p>
