# odin-recipes
First TOP Fundamentals HTML project

This project is essentially a medieval recipes website, containing some medieval recipes ordered by type. A historical viewpoint is present given the context of the website. With this project I have improved my overall coding skills, velocity when typing (especially in english), learned some new words, learned recipes, learned some history about them, improved my skills and understanding of html tags (like <ul> and <ol>) and when to use each tag (like <em> <i>) as well as some other usages of different elements, tags, and links-images. A skill that has really improved while I was working on this project was the overall usage and understanding of git, what commands to use and when, how they work, different types for commits and it's scopes, to write detailed yet brief and precise commits and much more. In this project I have demonstrated other skills like investigation capabilities, learning, and I also got out of the comfort zone to explore some other possibilities for different tasks and content.
